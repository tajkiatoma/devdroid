Suppose that I am interested in the area of Android development. I like to browse and answer Stack Overflow questions that are related to Android. However, it is tedious to search for the relevant questions on Stack Overflow.

 

I would like to see the titles of the 10 newest Android-related questions and the 10 most voted Android-related questions posted in the past week, on one page. In this way I can easily keep track of the relevant questions. In addition, I would like to be able to read the full information of these questions in a convenient way.

 

In the next 48 hours, can you implement the following:

- Extracting from stackoverflow.com the 10 newest Android-related questions, as well as the 10 most voted Android-related questions that are created in the past week.

- Building a simple website that displays the titles of the extracted questions.

- Providing a convenient way of displaying the full question thread after I click on one of the titles.

- Adding a cool feature that you came up with yourself (please explain the feature in your documentation).
